## 2. Goal: Capstone Checklist Points

<br>

The homework for Week 1 will focus strictly on Capstone planning.

Please refer to the Syllabus for Capstone requirements.

- If you have not done so, create an account for yourself on www.github.com (name should be professional)

- Create your `activities`, `homework`, and `capstone` repos on GitHub, and clone them down to your local environment inside your `/code/savvycoders/` folder.

- Inside your Capstone repo you might want to create a `documents` folder for all your project documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs. (It could be useful to create a separate images folder to collect images for your project.)

## Steps for Submitting the Week 1 Homework:

1.  Complete the Week 1 Homework

1.  Run the git commands as discussed in class, using git status before and after each command to make sure your files are correctly prepared to be pushed to GitHub!

    `git commit -m  "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`

    `git push`

    > **Note:** _Remember what we talked about in
    > regards to trying to push a branch that has not been created remotely. It may return as an **ERROR!!!** Read the message it returns as it tells you what command to run most of the time to resolve the no upstream branch error._

1.  Go to your Homework repository on GitHub

1.  Create Pull Request to merge the development branch into master

1.  Click on the green Compare & pull request button in the development had recent it pushed message

    > If there is no **compare & pull** request button, watch the video of tonight's class to see how to create a Pull request from the Pull requests tab.
